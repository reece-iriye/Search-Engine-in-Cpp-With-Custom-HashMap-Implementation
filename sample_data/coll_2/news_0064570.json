  "text": "BOSTON, Feb. 28, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- The Eaton Vance closed-end funds listed below released today the estimated sources of their February distributions (each a \"Fund\"). This press release is issued as required by the Funds' managed distribution plan (Plan) and an exemptive order received from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The Board of Trustees has approved the implementation of the Plan to make monthly or quarterly, as noted below, cash distributions to common shareholders, stated in terms of a fixed amount per common share. This information is sent to you for informational purposes only and is an estimate of the sources of the February distribution. It is not determinative of the tax character of a Fund's distributions for the 2018 calendar year. Shareholders should note that each Fund's total regular distribution amount is subject to change as a result of market conditions or other factors.\nIMPORTANT DISCLOSURE : You should not draw any conclusions about each Fund's investment performance from the amount of this distribution or from the terms of each Fund's Plan. Each Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net realized capital gains; therefore, a portion of your distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur for example, when some or all of the money that you invested in each Fund is paid back to you. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect each Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with \"yield\" or \"income.\" The amounts and sources of distributions reported in this notice are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for accounting and/or tax reporting purposes will depend upon each Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. Each Fund will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes.\nThe following tables set forth estimates of the sources of each Fund's February distribution and its cumulative distributions paid for its fiscal year through February 28, 2018, and information relating to each Fund's performance based on its net asset value (NAV) for certain periods.\nEaton Vance Enhanced Equity Income Fund (NYSE: EOI)\nDistribution Period:\nFebruary- 2018\nDistribution Amount per Common Share:\n$0.0864\nDistribution
